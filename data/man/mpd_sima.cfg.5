For instance a "AwesomePlugin" declared here gets its configuration from the corresponding section "[awesomeplugin]"\&.
.sp
The default list of plugins to load at startup:

\fBCrop\fR
is an utility plugin, it does not queue any tracks (cf\&. below)\&.

\fBRandom\fR
will queue a track at random if other plugins did not return any tracks\&.

You can add here as many plugins you want, currently shipping

The first is the last played artist and so on back in the history\&. Highter depth generates wider suggestions, it might help to reduce looping over same artists\&.

.SH "QUEUE MODES"
.PP
mpd\-sima offers different queue modes\&. All of them pick up tracks from artists similar to the last track in the queue\&.
.PP
mpd\-sima tries preferably to chose among unplayed artists or at least not recently played artist\&. Concerning track and album queue modes titles are chosen purely at random among unplayed tracks\&.
.PP
\fBtrack\fR

Queue a similar track chosen at random from a similar artist\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtop\fR

Queue a track from a similar artist, chosen among "top tracks" according to last\&.fm data mining\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBalbum\fR
.RS 4
Queue a whole album chosen at random from a similar artist\&.
.sp
\fINota Bene:\fR
.br

Due to the track point of view of database build upon tracks tags an album lookup for a specific artist will return albums as soon as this artist appears in a single track of the album\&.
.br

For instance looking for album from "The Velvet Underground" will fetch "Last Days" and "Juno" OSTs because the band appears on the soundtrack of these two movies\&.
.br

A solution is for you to set AlbumArtists tag to something different than the actual artist of the track\&. For compilations, OSTs etc\&. a strong convention is to use "Various Artists" for this tag\&.
.sp
mpd\-sima is currently looking for AlbumArtists tags and avoid album where this tag is set with "Various Artists"\&. If a single track within an album is found with AlbumArtists:"Various Artists" the complete album is skipped and won\*(Aqt be queued\&.
