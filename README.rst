MPD_sima Automagically add titles to MPD playlist.
==================================================

MPD_sima_ is a non interactive MPD autoqueue client running in the background.
It will queue new tracks chosen among artists similar to your current queued
tracks, provided a title is found in your music library.

Default is to fetch similar artists from last.fm webservice. There are other
plugins to fetch tracks based on genre tag or using specific complex filter.

Depending on the plugin used, MPD_sima can queue track, top track or whole
album for similar artists.

This client allows you to never run out of music when your queue is getting
short.
